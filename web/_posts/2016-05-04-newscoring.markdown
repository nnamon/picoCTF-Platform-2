Dear All,

Please note that we will be opening up the X-CTF Qualifiers registration to
teams of 4 from any Singaporean school. The members of the team have to be from
the same school. Since this means that there will be more than 11 schools
(formerly, all the tietary institutions), the qualification rules are changing
slightly.

Team scores will be based on number of points accrued first, and the time of the
last flag submitted next. So between two teams who score the same points, the
team that submitted the flag first will be ranked higher than the second team.

To select the 22 teams that will go on to the X-CTF Finals, we will take the top
team from each of the distinct schools, and rank the schools according to the
scores of these top teams. Finally, the top 2 teams from the top 11 ranked
schools will go onto the Finals. In the case where there exists only one team
from a school who places, we qualify one team from the next highest ranked
school. This ensures that a maximum of two teams can represent their varsities.

As an example, we'll use 10 teams from 5 schools with 6 slots for the Finals
with two slots per school:

Scoreboard:

1.  Team  1 - School A - 999 Pts
2.  Team  2 - School C - 998 Pts
3.  Team  3 - School B - 997 Pts
4.  Team  4 - School D - 996 Pts
5.  Team  5 - School A - 995 Pts
6.  Team  6 - School A - 994 Pts
7.  Team  7 - School E - 993 Pts
8.  Team  8 - School D - 992 Pts
9.  Team  9 - School E - 991 Pts
10. Team 10 - School A - 990 Pts

First, we categorise the teams into their schools.

School A - Highest 999
Team 1 (999), Team 5 (995), Team 6 (994), Team 10 (990)

School B - Highest 997
Team 3 (997)

School C - Highest 998
Team 2 (998)

School D - Highest 996
Team 4 (996), Team 8 (992)

School E - Highest 993
Team 7 (993), Team 9 (991)

Then, we rank the schools.

1. School A (4 Teams)
2. School C (1 Team)
3. School B (1 Team)
4. School D (2 Teams)
5. School E (2 Teams)

Now, we will determine the 6 slots that qualify.

1. Team 1 (School A)
2. Team 5 (School A)
3. Team 2 (School C)
4. Team 3 (School B)
5. Team 4 (School D)
6. Team 8 (School D)

Thank you.

Best regards,
NUS Greyhats
