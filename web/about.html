                <li>Do not delete or modify flags.</li>
                <li>ARP poisoning or any form of man-in-the-middle attack is
                    prohibited. This action is subject to disqualification.
                </li>
                <li>Sharing flags or solutions is prohibited. This action is
                    subject to disqualification.
                </li>
                <li>Brute-forcing flags will not be tolerated.</li>
                <li>Denial of service attacks on any challenge will not be
                    tolerated, unless the challenge calls for such an attack.
                </li>
                <li>If you find any bug in the system, let us know. We might
                    give you some bonus points.
                </li>
                <li>The organizer's decisions are final.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Flag Format</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>All flags will be in the format XCTF{xxxx} unless otherwise
                    stated.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Scoring</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Team scores will be based on number of points accrued first,
                    and the time of the last flag submitted next. So between two
                    teams who score the same points, the team that subits the
                    flag first will be ranked higher than the second team.
